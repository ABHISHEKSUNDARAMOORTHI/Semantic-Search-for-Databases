# 🔍 Semantic Search for Databases

## 📘 Project Overview
**Semantic Search for Databases** is an innovative project designed to revolutionize how data professionals interact with and discover data within complex database environments. 

Leveraging the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like **Google's Gemini**, this tool moves beyond traditional keyword-based searches to understand the **intent and context** of natural language queries—making data discovery intuitive and highly efficient for both Data Engineers and Data Analysts.

## ✨ Features

- **🗣️ Natural Language Querying**: Ask questions about your data using plain English, just as you would in a conversation.

- **🧠 Semantic Understanding**: Understands the meaning behind your queries—even without exact keywords.

- **⚙️ AI-Powered Data Discovery**: Matches natural language queries with database metadata (table names, column names, descriptions) using AI-generated embeddings.

### 🎯 Role-Specific Benefits
**For Data Engineers**:
- Accelerates onboarding
- Simplifies impact analysis
- Aids in data governance and compliance
- Optimizes storage
- Streamlines troubleshooting

**For Data Analysts**:
- Enables self-service exploration
- Speeds up dashboard/report creation
- Reduces dependency on tribal knowledge
- Identifies data gaps
- Enhances ad-hoc querying

- **📄 Clear Metadata Presentation**: Presents results with relevant metadata context, making it easier to understand the data.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Metadata Ingestion**: Extract table names, columns, descriptions, data types, and relationships.
2. **Embedding Generation**: Use Gemini API to convert metadata into high-dimensional vectors.
3. **Vector Database Storage**: Store embeddings for fast similarity-based semantic search.
4. **Natural Language Querying**: User query is embedded via Gemini API.
5. **Semantic Search**: Perform similarity search to find metadata closest in meaning to the query.
6. **Result Delivery**: Return relevant tables/columns with explanations and sample insights.

✅ Example: A search for "customer contact info" may return a `Customers` table with columns like `email_address`, `phone_number`, or `mailing_address`.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (Frontend)
- **Python 3.x** (Backend)
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (from Google Cloud Project)

---

### 🔁 Installation Steps

#### 1. Backend/API Setup (Python)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd semantic-search-for-databases/backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your Gemini API Key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"   # or load via .env
````

Run your backend (e.g., `python app.py`) and ensure it handles metadata ingestion and Gemini API interaction.

---

#### 2. Frontend Setup (React/HTML)

```bash
cd semantic-search-for-databases/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install    # or yarn install

# Start frontend
npm start      # or yarn start
```

---

#### 3. Database Integration

Extract metadata (manually or automated) and send it to Gemini for embedding. Store these embeddings in a **vector database**.

---

## 💻 Usage

1. Open the frontend app (e.g., [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
2. Enter natural language queries like:

   * “Find customer demographic data”
   * “Where is sales revenue stored?”
   * “Tables related to user activity”
3. View relevant metadata, sample data, and explanations.
